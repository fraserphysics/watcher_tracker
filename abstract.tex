\title{Abstract for Multi-Target Tracking}
\author{Andrew Fraser}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
I review the work on multi-target tracking that I have done for the
watcher project.  I emphasize the analogy with and use of the Viterbi
algorithm while acknowledging that operationally the procedures are
ultimately similar to the classic work of DB Reid in 1979.  I
illustrate with data from simulations and an unrestricted collect.
