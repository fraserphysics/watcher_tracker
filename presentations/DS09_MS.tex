  Exploiting image sequences like surveillance of vehicle or human
  movements or particles in fluid flows requires estimating target
  trajectories.  Although the dynamical systems community often maps
  sequences of non-invertible stochastic measurements to state
  sequences, the uncertain association between objects detected in
  successive images leads to combinatorial growth in the number of
  possibilities and may not be so familiar.  Commercial algorithms
  combine Kalman filters with multihypothesis tracking.  Research
  areas include belief propagation and particle filters.  We develop
  analogies to ideas the dynamical systems community have long
  considered followed by new applications and new techniques motivated
  by those applications.
